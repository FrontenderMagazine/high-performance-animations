# High Performance Animations

We’re going to cut straight to the chase. Modern browsers can animate four
things really cheaply: **position**, **scale**, **rotation** and **opacity**. If
you animate anything else, it’s *at your own risk*, and the chances are you’re
not going to hit a silky smooth 60fps.

Take a look at this side-by-side slow motion video of the same animation:

<iframe style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/-62uPWUxgcg?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>

One is done with transforms, the other isn’t. You can see what a difference it
makes, so let’s take look at why that is.

## From DOM to Pixels in DevTools

When you use the Chrome DevTools timeline you should see a pattern similar to
this:

![screenshot][DevTools waterfall] 

*Chrome DevTools frame mode. The higher up the waterfall you start, the more 
work the browser does.*

The process that the browser goes through is pretty simple: calculate the styles
that apply to the elements (Recalculate Style), generate the geometry and
position for each element (Layout), fill out the pixels for each element into
[layers][1] (Paint Setup and Paint) and draw the layers out to screen (Composite
Layers).

To achieve silky smooth animations you need to avoid work, and the best way to
do that is to only change properties that affect compositing -- transform and
opacity. **The higher up you start on the timeline waterfall the more work the
browser has to do to get pixels on to the screen.**

> This advice is broadly cross-browser compatible. Chrome, Firefox, Safari and 
Opera all hardware accelerate transforms and opacity. Unfortunately it is not 
clear what criteria Internet Explorer 10+ uses to determine if hardware 
acceleration is suitable, but hopefully that will become clearer when the F12 
tools in IE11 are shipped.

## Animating Layout Properties

When you change elements, the browser may need to do a layout, which involves
calculating the geometry (position and size) of all the elements affected by the
change. If you change one element, the geometry of other elements may need to be
recalculated. For example, if you change the width of the `<html>` element any
of its children may be affected. Due to the way elements overflow and affect one
another, changes further down the tree can sometimes result in layout
calculations all the way back up to the top.

The larger the tree of visible elements, the longer it takes to perform layout
calculations, so you must take pains to avoid animating properties that trigger
layout.

> Are you storing app state in the or elements with classes? When these elements 
are changed, the browser may have to redo style calculations and layout. Watch 
out for inadvertent layout triggers in your apps; they may not animate but they 
can be very expensive!

Here are the [most popular CSS properties][2] that, when changed, trigger layout:

**Styles that affect layout**

<table>
<tr><td>width</td><td>height</td></tr>
<tr><td>padding</td><td>margin</td></tr>
<tr><td>display</td><td>border-width</td></tr>
<tr><td>border</td><td>top</td></tr>
<tr><td>position</td><td>font-size</td></tr>
<tr><td>float</td><td>text-align</td></tr>
<tr><td>overflow-y</td><td>font-weight</td></tr>
<tr><td>overflow</td><td>left</td></tr>
<tr><td>font-family</td><td>line-height</td></tr>
<tr><td>vertical-align</td><td>right</td></tr>
<tr><td>clear</td><td>white-space</td></tr>
<tr><td>bottom</td><td>min-height</td></tr>
</table>

## Animating Paint Properties

Changing an element may also trigger painting, and the majority of painting in
modern browsers is done in software rasterizers. Depending on how the elements
in your app are grouped into layers, other elements besides the one that changed
may also need to be painted.

> If you’re new to the concept of layers you should read Tom Wiltzius’s 
[introduction to the topic][4].

There are many properties that will trigger a paint, but here are the most
popular:

**Styles that affect paint**

<table>
<tr><td>color</td><td>border-style</td></tr>
<tr><td>visibility</td><td>background</td></tr>
<tr><td>text-decoration</td><td>background-image</td></tr>
<tr><td>background-position</td><td>background-repeat</td></tr>
<tr><td>outline-color</td><td>outline</td></tr>
<tr><td>outline-style</td><td>border-radius</td></tr>
<tr><td>outline-width</td><td>box-shadow</td></tr>
<tr><td>background-size</td><td></td></tr>
</table>

If you animate any of the above properties the element(s) affected are
repainted, and the layers they belong to are uploaded to the GPU. On mobile
devices this is particularly expensive because CPUs are significantly less
powerful than their desktop counterparts, meaning that the painting work takes
longer; and the bandwidth between the CPU and GPU is limited, so texture uploads
take a long time.

## Animating Composite Properties

There is one CSS property, however, that you might expect to cause paints that
sometimes does not: opacity. Changes to opacity can be handled by the GPU during
compositing by simply painting the element texture with a lower alpha value. For
that to work, however, the element must be the **only one in the layer**. If it
has been grouped with other elements then changing the opacity at the GPU would
(incorrectly) fade them too.

In Blink and WebKit browsers a new layer is created for any element which has a
CSS transition or animation on opacity, but many developers use `translateZ(0)`
or `translate3d(0,0,0)` to manually force layer creation. Forcing layers to be
created ensures both that the layer is painted and ready-to-go as soon as the
animation starts (creating and painting a layer is a non-trivial operation and
can delay the start of your animation), and that there's no sudden change in
appearance due to antialiasing changes. Promoting layers should done sparingly,
though; you can overdo it and having [too many layers can cause jank][6].

> In Chrome, non-root, non-opaque layers use [grayscale antialiasing rather than 
subpixel antialiasing][7], which can be very noticeable, especially if the 
antialiasing method changes suddenly. If you are going to promote an element 
don’t wait until the animation starts, do it ahead of time.

Changing the transform of an element boils down to changes to its position,
rotation or scale. Often, position is animated by setting the `left` and `top`
properties. The problem is, as shown above, `left` and `top` both trigger layout
operations, and that's expensive. The better solution is to use a `translate` on
the element, which does not trigger layout.

> In Chrome Canary and Safari you can also animate filters, as these are handled 
off the main thread, are accelerated and generally perform very well. But since 
filters are not yet supported in Internet Explorer or Firefox you should proceed 
with caution.

## Imperative vs Declarative Animations

Developers often have to decide if they will animate with JavaScript
(imperative) or CSS (declarative). There are pros and cons to each, so let’s
take a look:

### Imperative

The main pro of imperative animations happens to also be its main con: it’s
running in JavaScript on the browser’s main thread. The main thread is already
busy with other JavaScript, style calculations, layout and painting. Often there
is thread contention. This substantially increases the chance of missing
animation frames, which is the very last thing you want.

Animating in JavaScript does give you a lot of control: starting, pausing,
reversing, interrupting and cancelling are trivial. Some effects, like
[parallax][8] scrolling, can only be achieved in JavaScript.

### Declarative

The alternative approach is to write your transitions and animations in CSS. The
primary advantage is that the browser can optimize the animation. It can create
layers if necessary, and run some operations off the main thread which, as you
have seen, is a good thing. The major con of CSS animations for many is that
they lack the expressive power of JavaScript animations. It is very difficult to
combine animations in a meaningful way, which means authoring animations gets
complex and error-prone.

## Looking to the future

As web standards evolve, some of the limitations around animation will go away.
There is a proposal by Google’s Ian Vollick that investigates the concept of
allowing [JavaScript animations via workers][9], providing the animation does
not trigger layout or style recalculations.

For those interested in a more declarative approach to animation there is the
[Web Animations specification][10], which [Jake Archibald has written about
extensively][11].

## Conclusion

Animating well is core to a great web experience. You should always look to
avoid animating properties that will trigger layout or paints, both of which are
expensive and may lead to skipped frames. Declarative animations are preferable
to imperative since the browser has the opportunity to optimize ahead of time.

Today transforms are the best properties to animate because the GPU can assist
with the heavy lifting, so where you can limit your animations to these, do so.

* opacity
* translate
* rotate
* scale

In the future there may be new ways of animating that allow you to be as
expressive as you can be with JavaScript, but without the associated main thread
cost; or as optimized as CSS animations but without the restrictions, but until
then plan your animations for a silky smooth experience.
